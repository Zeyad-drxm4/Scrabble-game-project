# Scrabble-game-project
This Scrabble game in C++ utilizes deque for efficient tile management, allowing players to draw and place tiles from both ends. A vector of pairs (vector<pair<char, int>>) is used to store letter-value mappings, enabling quick score calculations. The game board is represented using a 2D array, and word validation is performed through a file-based dictionary lookup. Players take turns forming words and earning points based on tile values and board bonuses. This project demonstrates effective use of STL containers for optimizing gameplay mechanics while maintaining clean and efficient code.
